    "Text":"Switch Orange\/Tangerine soda comes in a smaller can than a regular soda (a little over 8 ounces, compared to the usual 12 ounces in a regular soft drink can).  It is labeled as \"all-natural\" because the sugars in it come from fruit juices rather than added corn syrup.  I chilled the can of Switch in my refrigerator overnight, and then sampled it poured over ice in a glass.  The color is not so \"neon\" orange as some orange sodas -- it is a softer orange color.  The fizz is also less than in a regular soft drink.I found the flavor pleasing, with none of the chemical or metallic taste which can occur in many brands of orange soda.  The soft fizziness of the drink complemented the orange flavor well.  I didn't really get a true tangerine taste from the soda.  Tangerines are a very acidic fruit, and have a very distinct taste, which I did not really get from this soda.  However, the taste is very smooth and quite refreshing.  My teenaged daughters and their friends loved this soda, and I have been re-ordering it every so often as a treat. Switch is a bit pricy.  You can cut down on the price by signing up for regular deliveries, but so far I haven't given in to that temptation.  However I am buying it for special occasions, for the travel cooler, and for planned teen get-togethers.\n",

    "Text":"The LaraBar Chocolate snack is really quite tasty. The texture is good, and it has plenty of nuts. A filling treat, it is also thick and chewy, just like a brownie should be. It is a little shy on chocolate taste, though. If it had the chocolate zing of a PureBar Pure Bar Chocolate Brownie Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12), then it would be the best of the best. I recommend this healthy snack for anyone who is looking for a healthy gluten-free alternative to a brownie. YUM.\n",

    "Text":"I have been a long-time fan of Rishi Tea.  They are a company that has a far superior product to most tea found on the market today.  For years, I have ordered excellent teas, handpicked most of the time, from specific regions where only the best of its kind can be grown.  This White Tea (called Silver Needle here) is the first blush, the very first tiny leaves to come out in the spring and they have exceptionally light and delicate flavor.  The Jasmine flowers mixed in are just in the right proportion.  I am not usually a fan of Jasmine Tea.  Normally the only thing you can taste or smell is the Jasmine overpowering your senses.  This is not the case with this tea.  The mix is masterfully blended to give enough Jasmine without overpowering the delicate taste of newly leafed tea.  I hope AMAZON.COM continues to offer these outstanding products from this special company.  I have never tasted a RISHI Tea that I didn't like.  Silver Needle Jasmine is no exception.  If you are looking for a special tea to enjoy on a cool night, this is the one.\n",

    "Text":"I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with \"filler\" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and\/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.\n",

    "Text":"Working great so far! Previously I've used Lanisoh and two types of Medela bags (the ones with the sticky strap and the ones that require an adaptor - I prefer the adaptor ones out of those two). I liked being able to pump directly into the Medela bags, however because the measurements are skewed when you pump directly into those bags, it was hard to know how much was in each. So I had already started pumping into bottles and then pouring into bags... and then I figured since I was already doing that, why spend all the extra money buying the expensive bags JUST because I could pump into them?I tried Lanisoh, but I don't like them: they just feel like the sides could split at any moment and I could lose liquid gold. That's what differentiates the Honeysuckle bags for me: they have a stronger, thicker side seam that makes me feel like they'll hold and last. It's also nice that they're biodegradable. I'm on my second set of 75 now, and next time I plan to order the big 300 count box.3.1.12 Update:I just used my 500th Honeysuckle bag and so far we've had ZERO leaks and have been extremely happy with this product! I also like the changes they've made to the bags recently -- adding a place to write \"volume\". Keep up the good work, Honeysuckle!\n",

The grove square french vanilla is just nasty really and it leaves a bad after taste. oh and you have to run a hot water cycle after using it to clean the machine, nothing lefted in the k-cup either, well just a little bit of water to leak from the k-cup when throwing away. I will not buy this again at any price.The only reason for the one star rating was because the shipping and packaging of the products was nicely done, free super saving shipping is great. I just wish the contents of said packaging had been on par. anyone know of a good cappuccino for the keurig?\n",

    "Text":"The product comes as a hard and apparently concentrated solid. It's similar to Artisana \"coconut butter.\" Both products are harder than butter at room temperature, so a better description might be \"coconut tallow\" or \"coconut wax\" (no offense intended, those are just what it reminds me most of). The package says to add 2 Tbsps of hot water to 1 Tbsp Creamed Coconut and stir briskly until dissolved, which was a surprise, because the product was recommended on a raw forum. Being a high raw omnivore myself I'm also not used to foods that need some heat and processing and have instructions and I figured others might be served by this warning, as I tasted some without first diluting it and that was a horrible experience.I followed the instructions and found it wouldn't dissolve without first breaking up the chunks into tiny bits. You can also melt the whole package contents in a bowl of hot water, as a commenter kindly explained to me. The result was still too thick, drying, and gluey and it needed more water. I added two more tablespoons and it was less bad, but I still didn't care much for it. It has a sawdust-like texture and the gritty bits stuck in my throat and the taste was unpleasant--like coconut that's been heat-dried and stored for months. Not surprisingly, the package says the product is dehydrated.This and the similar Artisana coconut butters are some of the least pleasant foods I've ever tried and I'm puzzled why people like them. If you care to explain why you like it, feel free to comment, because I know some people love it. For those that like this sort of product, I think they might like this one OK, so even though I would give it one star, I compromised and gave it 3. Top quality coconut water, coconut candy bars and coconut sorbet remain my favorite-tasting packaged coconut foods.\n",
